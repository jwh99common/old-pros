              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Most boards wouldn't operate without non-executive directors (NED) providing independent challenge and expertise. Yet when it comes to MSP governance, where you're spending millions annually, those service delivery meetings often lack that same critical external perspective.
<p>
We propose a straightforward model: an independent advisor who sits in your service reviews with your managed service providers, bringing:
</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Objective challenge on service levels, commitments and roadmaps</p></li>

<li><p>Pattern recognition from working across multiple MSP relationships</p></li>

<li><p>Commercial leverage to help you hold providers accountable when delivery slips</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Think of it as a NED for your outsourcing relationships; someone without internal politics or history, focused purely on whether you're getting the value you're paying for.

This isn't about adding overhead. It's about ensuring the substantial investment you're making in managed services actually delivers. One good challenge in a service review can unlock six figures in value or avoided costs.

We'd welcome 15 minutes to explore whether this might work for your organisation. Are you free next week?

Program and project delivery can sometimes appear chaotic and sometimes it is. 
We look to reduce that complexity and improve observability and delivery. 
Our experience allows us to provide structure and governance with a light touch so that you can be 
confident that projects that are green are actually green, and have enough time 
to mitigate when things go off road.
